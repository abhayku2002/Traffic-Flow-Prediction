# Traffic-Flow-Prediction

Traffic congestion and related problems are a common concern in urban areas. Understanding traffic patterns and analyzing data can provide valuable insights for transportation planning, infrastructure development, and congestion management.

# What exactly is this dataset and how was it created?
it is a valuable resource for studying traffic conditions as it contains information collected by a computer vision model. The model detects four classes of vehicles: cars, bikes, buses, and trucks. The dataset is stored in a CSV file and includes additional columns such as time in hours, date, days of the week, and counts for each vehicle type (CarCount, BikeCount, BusCount, TruckCount). The "Total" column represents the total count of all vehicle types detected within a 15-minute duration.
